Continue to the top of the movement and pause, then slowly return to the start position.","['dumbbells', 'incline bench']","Keep your back firmly against the incline bench with feet together; keep upper arms stationary and move only at the elbows. Lift and lower under control without swinging, use a manageable weight, and avoid locking the elbows or arching your back."
Wide-grip barbell curl,strength,biceps,beginner,"Stand up with your torso upright while holding a barbell at the wide outer handle. The palm of your hands should be facing forward. The elbows should be close to the torso. This will be your starting position. While holding the upper arms stationary, curl the weights forward while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Tip: Only the forearms should move. Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a second and squeeze the biceps hard. Slowly begin to bring the bar back to starting position as your breathe in. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations:  You can also perform this movement using an E-Z bar or E-Z attachment hooked to a low pulley. This variation seems to really provide a good contraction at the top of the movement. You may also use the closer grip for variety purposes.",['barbell'],"Stand upright with elbows kept close to the torso and upper arms stationary; only the forearms should move. Control the weight, especially on the descent, and coordinate breathing (exhale while curling, inhale while lowering)."
Hammer Curls,strength,biceps,intermediate,"Stand up with your torso upright and a dumbbell on each hand being held at arms length. The elbows should be close to the torso. The palms of the hands should be facing your torso. This will be your starting position. Now, while holding your upper arm stationary, exhale and curl the weight forward while contracting the biceps. Continue to raise the weight until the biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbell is at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a brief moment as you squeeze the biceps. Tip: Focus on keeping the elbow stationary and only moving your forearm. After the brief pause, inhale and slowly begin the lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: There are many possible variations for this movement. For instance, you can perform the exercise sitting down on a bench with or without back support and you can also perform it by alternating arms; first lift the right arm for one repetition, then the left, then the right, etc.",['dumbbells'],"Stand upright with elbows kept close to your sides and wrists neutral; move only the forearms. Avoid swinging or arching your back, control the lowering phase, and use a weight you can lift with good form. Exhale while curling and inhale while lowering."
EZ-Bar Curl,strength,biceps,intermediate,"Stand up straight while holding an EZ curl bar at the wide outer handle. The palms of your hands should be facing forward and slightly tilted inward due to the shape of the bar. Keep your elbows close to your torso. This will be your starting position. Now, while keeping your upper arms stationary, exhale and curl the weights forward while contracting the biceps. Focus on only moving your forearms. Continue to raise the weight until your biceps are fully contracted and the bar is at shoulder level. Hold the top contracted position for a moment and squeeze the biceps. Then inhale and slowly lower the bar back to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: You can also perform this movement using an E-Z attachment hooked to a low pulley. This variation seems to really provide a good contraction at the top of the movement. You may also use the closer grip for variety purposes.",['ez curl bar'],"Stand upright with a stable torso, keep elbows close to your sides, and keep your upper arms fixed—only the forearms move. Avoid swinging or leaning back; control the weight, especially on the way down. Exhale as you curl and inhale as you lower."
Zottman Curl,strength,biceps,intermediate,"Stand up with your torso upright and a dumbbell in each hand being held at arms length. The elbows should be close to the torso. Make sure the palms of the hands are facing each other. This will be your starting position. While holding the upper arm stationary, curl the weights while contracting the biceps as you breathe out. Only the forearms should move. Your wrist should rotate so that you have a supinated (palms up) grip. Continue the movement until your biceps are fully contracted and the dumbbells are at shoulder level. Hold the contracted position for a second as you squeeze the biceps. Now during the contracted position, rotate your wrist until you now have a pronated (palms facing down) grip with the thumb at a higher position than the pinky. Slowly begin to bring the dumbbells back down using the pronated grip. As the dumbbells close your thighs, start rotating the wrist so that you go back to a neutral (palms facing your body) grip. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.",['dumbbells'],"Stand upright with a neutral spine, keep elbows close and upper arms stationary, and rotate wrists smoothly between neutral/supinated/pronated grips to avoid strain. Use a manageable weight, avoid swinging or using momentum, control the lowering phase, and breathe steadily (exhale on the curl)."
Dumbbell Bench Press,strength,chest,intermediate,"Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand resting on top of your thighs. The palms of your hands will be facing each other. Then, using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells up, lift the dumbbells one at a time so that you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width. Once at shoulder width, rotate your wrists forward so that the palms of your hands are facing away from you. The dumbbells should be just to the sides of your chest, with your upper arm and forearm creating a 90 degree angle. Be sure to maintain full control of the dumbbells at all times. This will be your starting position. Then, as you breathe out, use your chest to push the dumbbells up. Lock your arms at the top of the lift and squeeze your chest, hold for a second and then begin coming down slowly. Tip: Ideally, lowering the weight should take about twice as long as raising it. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions of your training program.  Caution: When you are done, do not drop the dumbbells next to you as this is dangerous to your rotator cuff in your shoulders and others working out around you. Just lift your legs from the floor bending at the knees, twist your wrists so that the palms of your hands are facing each other and place the dumbbells on top of your thighs. When both dumbbells are touching your thighs simultaneously push your upper torso up (while pressing the dumbbells on your thighs) and also perform a slight kick forward with your legs (keeping the dumbbells on top of the thighs). By doing this combined movement, momentum will help you get back to a sitting position with both dumbbells still on top of your thighs. At this moment you can place the dumbbells on the floor. Variations: Another variation of this exercise is to perform it with the palms of the hands facing each other. Also, you can perform the exercise with the palms facing each other and then twisting the wrist as you lift the dumbbells so that at the top of the movement the palms are facing away from the body. I personally do not use this variation very often as it seems to be hard on my shoulders.","['dumbbells', 'flat bench']","Maintain full control of the weights and lower them slower than you raise them. Do not drop the dumbbells—use the thigh-assisted method to return to a seated position to protect your shoulders and people nearby. Use caution with twisting-grip variations, as they can stress the shoulders."
Close-grip bench press,strength,chest,intermediate,"Lie back on a flat bench. Using a close grip (around shoulder width), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. This will be your starting position. As you breathe in, come down slowly until you feel the bar on your middle chest. Tip: Make sure that - as opposed to a regular bench press - you keep the elbows close to the torso at all times in order to maximize triceps involvement. After a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your triceps muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions. When you are done, place the bar back in the rack.  Caution: If you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used. Also, beware of letting the bar drift too far forward. You want the bar to fall on your middle chest and nowhere else. Variations: This exercise can also be performed with an e-z bar using the inner handle as well as dumbbells, in which case the palms of the hands will be facing each other.","['barbell', 'flat bench', 'rack']","Use a spotter if you’re new; if none is available, use conservative weight. Keep elbows close to your torso, lower the bar under control to the mid-chest, and avoid letting it drift forward. Re-rack the bar securely."
Dumbbell Flyes,strength,chest,intermediate,"Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell on each hand resting on top of your thighs. The palms of your hand will be facing each other. Then using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells, lift the dumbbells one at a time so you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width with the palms of your hands facing each other. Raise the dumbbells up like you're pressing them, but stop and hold just before you lock out. This will be your starting position. With a slight bend on your elbows in order to prevent stress at the biceps tendon, lower your arms out at both sides in a wide arc until you feel a stretch on your chest. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Keep in mind that throughout the movement, the arms should remain stationary; the movement should only occur at the shoulder joint. Return your arms back to the starting position as you squeeze your chest muscles and breathe out. Tip: Make sure to use the same arc of motion used to lower the weights. Hold for a second at the contracted position and repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.  Variations: You may want to use a palms facing forward version for different stimulation.","['dumbbells', 'flat bench']","Keep a slight bend in your elbows to protect the biceps tendon; avoid locking out and keep the arms fixed so movement occurs only at the shoulder. Lower in a slow, wide arc only until you feel a chest stretch (don’t overstretch), then return along the same path with control and steady breathing."
Low-cable cross-over,strength,chest,intermediate,"To move into the starting position, place the pulleys at the low position, select the resistance to be used and grasp a handle in each hand. Step forward, gaining tension in the pulleys. Your palms should be facing forward, hands below the waist, and your arms straight. This will be your starting position. With a slight bend in your arms, draw your hands upward and toward the midline of your body. Your hands should come together in front of your chest, palms facing up. Return your arms back to the starting position after a brief pause.","['cable machine', 'single-grip handles']","Set pulleys low and step forward carefully to create tension. Keep a slight bend in the elbows, control the motion without letting the stack slam, and avoid excessive weight to reduce shoulder strain."
Incline dumbbell bench press,strength,chest,intermediate,"Lie back on an incline bench with a dumbbell in each hand atop your thighs. The palms of your hands will be facing each other. Then, using your thighs to help push the dumbbells up, lift the dumbbells one at a time so that you can hold them at shoulder width. Once you have the dumbbells raised to shoulder width, rotate your wrists forward so that the palms of your hands are facing away from you. This will be your starting position. Be sure to keep full control of the dumbbells at all times. Then breathe out and push the dumbbells up with your chest. Lock your arms at the top, hold for a second, and then start slowly lowering the weight. Tip Ideally, lowering the weights should take about twice as long as raising them. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions. When you are done, place the dumbbells back on your thighs and then on the floor. This is the safest manner to release the dumbbells.  Variations: You can use several angles on the incline bench if the bench you are using is adjustable. Another variation of this exercise is to perform it with the palms of the hands facing each other. Also, you can perform the exercise with the palms facing each other and then twisting the wrist as you lift the dumbbells so that at the top of the movement the palms are facing away from the body. I personally do not use this variation very often as it seems to be hard on my shoulders.","['dumbbells', 'incline bench']","Keep full control of the dumbbells, use a slow and controlled tempo (lower twice as long as you lift), and when finished place the dumbbells onto your thighs before the floor to release safely. Avoid twisting variations if they cause shoulder discomfort."
Dumbbell front raise to lateral raise,strength,shoulders,intermediate,"In a standing position, hold a pair of dumbbells at your side. This will be your starting position. Keeping your elbows slightly bent, raise the weights directly in front of you to shoulder height, avoiding any swinging or cheating. At the top of the exercise move the weights out in front of you, keeping your arms extended. Lower the weights with a controlled motion. On the next repetition, raise the weights in front of you to shoulder height before moving the weights laterally to your sides. Lower the weights to the starting position.",['dumbbells'],Keep elbows slightly bent with arms extended; raise only to shoulder height; avoid swinging or cheating and lower the weights under control.
Single-arm palm-in dumbbell shoulder press,strength,shoulders,intermediate,Start by having a dumbbell in one hand with your arm fully extended to the side using a neutral grip. Use your other arm to hold on to an incline bench to keep your balance. Your feet should be shoulder width apart from each other. Now slowly lift the dumbbell up until you create a 90 degree angle with your arm. Note: Your forearm should be perpendicular to the floor. Continue to maintain a neutral grip throughout the entire exercise. Slowly lift the dumbbell up until your arm is fully extended. This the starting position. While inhaling lower the weight down until your arm is at a 90 degree angle again. Feel the contraction for a second and then lift the weight back up towards the starting position while exhaling. Remember to hold on to the incline bench and keep your feet positioned to keep balance during the exercise. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. Switch arms and repeat the exercise.  Variation: This exercise can be performed with dumbbells in each arm as the dumbbells will help to keep you balanced. This is another great way to add variety to your routines and keep them interesting.,"['dumbbell', 'incline bench']",Use an incline bench for balance and keep feet shoulder-width. Maintain a neutral (palm-in) grip with the forearm perpendicular to the floor. Move slowly and under control—lower only to about a 90° elbow angle—exhale on the press and inhale while lowering. Avoid losing balance.
Single-arm kettlebell push-press,strength,shoulders,intermediate,"Hold a kettlebell by the handle. Clean the kettlebell to your shoulder by extending through the legs and hips as you pull the kettlebell towards your shoulder. Rotate your wrist as you do so, so that the palm faces forward. This will be your starting position. Dip your body by bending the knees, keeping your torso upright. Immediately reverse direction, driving through the heels, in essence jumping to create momentum. As you do so, press the kettlebell overhead to lockout by extending the arms, using your body's momentum to move the weight. Lower the weight to perform the next repetition.",['kettlebell'],"Keep your torso upright during the dip, drive through the heels, use controlled leg-driven momentum to press the kettlebell overhead to lockout, and lower it under control."
Seated barbell shoulder press,strength,shoulders,intermediate,"Sit on a Military Press Bench with a bar behind your head and either have a spotter give you the bar (better on the rotator cuff this way) or pick it up yourself carefully with a pronated grip (palms facing forward). Tip: Your grip should be wider than shoulder width and it should create a 90-degree angle between the forearm and the upper arm as the barbell goes down. Once you pick up the barbell with the correct grip length, lift the bar up over your head by locking your arms. Hold at about shoulder level and slightly in front of your head. This is your starting position. Lower the bar down to the collarbone slowly as you inhale. Lift the bar back up to the starting position as you exhale. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations:  This exercise can also be performed standing but those with lower back problems are better off performing this seated variety. The behind the neck variation is not recommended for people with shoulder problems as it can be hard on the rotator cuff due to the hyperextension created by bringing the bar behind the neck.","['barbell', 'military press bench']","Lower the bar under control to the collarbone and keep it slightly in front of your head. Use the seated version if you have lower-back issues and consider a spotter for the handoff. Avoid the behind-the-neck variation, especially if you have shoulder problems, as it can stress the rotator cuff."
Seated Dumbbell Press,strength,shoulders,intermediate,"Grab a couple of dumbbells and sit on a military press bench or a utility bench that has a back support on it as you place the dumbbells upright on top of your thighs. Clean the dumbbells up one at a time by using your thighs to bring the dumbbells up to shoulder height at each side. Rotate the wrists so that the palms of your hands are facing forward. This is your starting position. As you exhale, push the dumbbells up until they touch at the top. After a second pause, slowly come down back to the starting position as you inhale. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations:  You can perform the exercise standing or sitting on a regular flat bench. For people with lower back problems, the version described is the recommended one. You can also perform the exercise as Arnold Schwarzenegger used to do it, which is to start holding the dumbbells with a supinated grip (palms facing you) in front of your shoulders and then, as you start pushing up, you align the dumbbells in the starting position described on step 3 by rotating your wrists and touch the dumbbells at the top. As you come down, then you would go back to the starting position by rotating the wrist throughout the lowering portion until the palms of your hands are facing you. This variation is called the Arnold Press. However, it is not recommended if you have rotator cuff problems.","['dumbbells', 'bench with back support']","Use the seated version with back support if you have lower back issues, and avoid the Arnold press variation if you have rotator cuff problems. Perform reps in control (exhale on the press, inhale on the lower)."
Triceps dip,strength,triceps,intermediate,"To get into the starting position, hold your body at arm's length with your arms nearly locked above the bars. Now, inhale and slowly lower yourself downward. Your torso should remain upright and your elbows should stay close to your body. This helps to better focus on tricep involvement. Lower yourself until there is a 90 degree angle formed between the upper arm and forearm. Then, exhale and push your torso back up using your triceps to bring your body back to the starting position. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.  Variations: If you are new at this exercise and do not have the strength to perform it, use a dip assist machine if available. These machines use weight to help you push your bodyweight. Otherwise, a spotter holding your legs can help. More advanced lifters can add weight to the exercise by using a weight belt that allows the addition of weighted plates.",['parallel bars'],"Keep torso upright and elbows close; lower slowly only to about a 90° elbow angle, then press up—avoid excessive depth, swinging, or hard lockout to protect shoulders and elbows. If you can’t perform bodyweight dips, use a dip-assist machine or a spotter; add weight with a belt only after mastering strict reps without pain."
Dumbbell floor press,powerlifting,triceps,intermediate,"Lay on the floor holding dumbbells in your hands. Your knees can be bent. Begin with the weights fully extended above you. Lower the weights until your upper arm comes in contact with the floor. You can tuck your elbows to emphasize triceps size and strength, or to focus on your chest angle your arms to the side. Pause at the bottom, and then bring the weight together at the top by extending through the elbows.",['dumbbells'],Control the descent and lower only until your upper arm contacts the floor; pause at the bottom and avoid bouncing. Keep your elbows in a comfortable position (tucked or slightly flared) and use a weight you can control.
Cable V-bar push-down,strength,triceps,intermediate,"Attach a V-Bar to a high pulley and grab with an overhand grip (palms facing down) at shoulder width. Standing upright with the torso straight and a very small inclination forward, bring the upper arms close to your body and perpendicular to the floor. The forearms should be pointing up towards the pulley as they hold the bar. The thumbs should be higher than the small finger. This is your starting position. Using the triceps, bring the bar down until it touches the front of your thighs and the arms are fully extended perpendicular to the floor. The upper arms should always remain stationary next to your torso and only the forearms should move. Exhale as you perform this movement. After a second hold at the contracted position, bring the V-Bar slowly up to the starting point. Breathe in as you perform this step. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: There are many variations to this movement. For instance you can use an E-Z bar attachment as well as a straight cable bar attachment for different variations of the exercise. Also, you can attach a rope to the pulley as well as using a reverse grip on the bar exercises. Just like the Triceps Pushdown but with the V-Bar attachment.","['cable machine', 'v-bar attachment']","Stand upright with only a slight forward lean, keep elbows pinned to your sides and upper arms stationary; move only the forearms. Use a controlled motion (don’t swing or use momentum), exhale on the pressdown and control the return. Choose a load that allows full extension without pain and avoid hyperextending or flaring the elbows or rounding the back."
EZ-Bar Skullcrusher,strength,triceps,intermediate,"Using a close grip, lift the EZ bar and hold it with your elbows in as you lie on the bench. Your arms should be perpendicular to the floor. This will be your starting position. Keeping the upper arms stationary, lower the bar by allowing the elbows to flex. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Pause once the bar is directly above the forehead. Lift the bar back to the starting position by extending the elbow and exhaling. Repeat.","['ez curl bar', 'bench']","Use a close grip with elbows tucked and upper arms stationary; control the descent and stop with the bar just above your forehead to avoid impact. Keep arms perpendicular to the floor and breathe properly (inhale down, exhale up)."
Decline EZ-bar skullcrusher,strength,triceps,intermediate,"Secure your legs at the end of the decline bench and slowly lay down on the bench. Using a close grip (a grip that is slightly less than shoulder width), lift the EZ bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked and elbows in. The arms should be perpendicular to the floor. This will be your starting position. Tip: In order to protect your rotator cuff, it is best if you have a spotter help you lift the barbell off the rack. As you breathe in and you keep the upper arms stationary, bring the bar down slowly by moving your forearms in a semicircular motion towards you until you feel the bar slightly touch your forehead. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement. Lift the bar back to the starting position by contracting the triceps and exhaling. Repeat until the recommended amount of repetitions is performed.  Variations: You can use a straight bar or dumbbells to perform this movement. You can also perform it on a flat bench as well.","['ez curl bar', 'decline bench', 'barbell rack']","Secure your legs on the decline bench. Use a spotter to help lift the bar from the rack to protect your rotator cuff. Keep upper arms stationary and elbows in, and lower the bar slowly to lightly touch your forehead—control the movement to avoid striking your head."
