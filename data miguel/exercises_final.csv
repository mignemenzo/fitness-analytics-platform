Dumbbell Bench Press,strength,chest,intermediate,"Lie down on a flat bench with a dumbbell in each hand resting on top of your thighs. The palms of your hands will be facing each other. Then, using your thighs to help raise the dumbbells up, lift the dumbbells one at a time so that you can hold them in front of you at shoulder width. Once at shoulder width, rotate your wrists forward so that the palms of your hands are facing away from you. The dumbbells should be just to the sides of your chest, with your upper arm and forearm creating a 90 degree angle. Be sure to maintain full control of the dumbbells at all times. This will be your starting position. Then, as you breathe out, use your chest to push the dumbbells up. Lock your arms at the top of the lift and squeeze your chest, hold for a second and then begin coming down slowly. Tip: Ideally, lowering the weight should take about twice as long as raising it. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions of your training program.  Caution: When you are done, do not drop the dumbbells next to you as this is dangerous to your rotator cuff in your shoulders and others working out around you. Just lift your legs from the floor bending at the knees, twist your wrists so that the palms of your hands are facing each other and place the dumbbells on top of your thighs. When both dumbbells are touching your thighs simultaneously push your upper torso up (while pressing the dumbbells on your thighs) and also perform a slight kick forward with your legs (keeping the dumbbells on top of the thighs). By doing this combined movement, momentum will help you get back to a sitting position with both dumbbells still on top of your thighs. At this moment you can place the dumbbells on the floor. Variations: Another variation of this exercise is to perform it with the palms of the hands facing each other. Also, you can perform the exercise with the palms facing each other and then twisting the wrist as you lift the dumbbells so that at the top of the movement the palms are facing away from the body. I personally do not use this variation very often as it seems to be hard on my shoulders.","['dumbbells', 'flat bench']","Maintain full control of the weights and lower them slower than you raise them. Do not drop the dumbbells—use the thigh-assisted method to return to a seated position to protect your shoulders and people nearby. Use caution with twisting-grip variations, as they can stress the shoulders."
Close-grip bench press,strength,chest,intermediate,"Lie back on a flat bench. Using a close grip (around shoulder width), lift the bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked. This will be your starting position. As you breathe in, come down slowly until you feel the bar on your middle chest. Tip: Make sure that - as opposed to a regular bench press - you keep the elbows close to the torso at all times in order to maximize triceps involvement. After a second pause, bring the bar back to the starting position as you breathe out and push the bar using your triceps muscles. Lock your arms in the contracted position, hold for a second and then start coming down slowly again. Tip: It should take at least twice as long to go down than to come up. Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions. When you are done, place the bar back in the rack.  Caution: If you are new at this exercise, it is advised that you use a spotter. If no spotter is available, then be conservative with the amount of weight used. Also, beware of letting the bar drift too far forward. You want the bar to fall on your middle chest and nowhere else. Variations: This exercise can also be performed with an e-z bar using the inner handle as well as dumbbells, in which case the palms of the hands will be facing each other.","['barbell', 'flat bench', 'rack']","Use a spotter if you’re new; if none is available, use conservative weight.

The forearms should do no other work except for holding the dumbbell; therefore do not try to pull the dumbbell up using the forearms. Lower the resistance straight down to the starting position. Breathe in as you perform this step. Repeat the movement for the specified amount of repetitions. Switch sides and repeat again with the other arm.  Variations: One-arm rows can also be performed using a high pulley or a low pulley instead of a dumbbell.","['dumbbell', 'flat bench']",Keep your lower back straight and torso stationary to avoid strain; do not round or twist. Pull with the back muscles (forearms only hold the dumbbell) and keep the upper arm close to your side. Use the bench for support and control the weight; exhale on the pull and inhale on the descent.

Dumbbell floor press,powerlifting,triceps,intermediate,"Lay on the floor holding dumbbells in your hands. Your knees can be bent. Begin with the weights fully extended above you. Lower the weights until your upper arm comes in contact with the floor. You can tuck your elbows to emphasize triceps size and strength, or to focus on your chest angle your arms to the side. Pause at the bottom, and then bring the weight together at the top by extending through the elbows.",['dumbbells'],Control the descent and lower only until your upper arm contacts the floor; pause at the bottom and avoid bouncing. Keep your elbows in a comfortable position (tucked or slightly flared) and use a weight you can control.
Cable V-bar push-down,strength,triceps,intermediate,"Attach a V-Bar to a high pulley and grab with an overhand grip (palms facing down) at shoulder width. Standing upright with the torso straight and a very small inclination forward, bring the upper arms close to your body and perpendicular to the floor. The forearms should be pointing up towards the pulley as they hold the bar. The thumbs should be higher than the small finger. This is your starting position. Using the triceps, bring the bar down until it touches the front of your thighs and the arms are fully extended perpendicular to the floor. The upper arms should always remain stationary next to your torso and only the forearms should move. Exhale as you perform this movement. After a second hold at the contracted position, bring the V-Bar slowly up to the starting point. Breathe in as you perform this step. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: There are many variations to this movement. For instance you can use an E-Z bar attachment as well as a straight cable bar attachment for different variations of the exercise. Also, you can attach a rope to the pulley as well as using a reverse grip on the bar exercises. Just like the Triceps Pushdown but with the V-Bar attachment.","['cable machine', 'v-bar attachment']","Stand upright with only a slight forward lean, keep elbows pinned to your sides and upper arms stationary; move only the forearms. Use a controlled motion (don’t swing or use momentum), exhale on the pressdown and control the return. Choose a load that allows full extension without pain and avoid hyperextending or flaring the elbows or rounding the back."
EZ-Bar Skullcrusher,strength,triceps,intermediate,"Using a close grip, lift the EZ bar and hold it with your elbows in as you lie on the bench. Your arms should be perpendicular to the floor. This will be your starting position. Keeping the upper arms stationary, lower the bar by allowing the elbows to flex. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. Pause once the bar is directly above the forehead. Lift the bar back to the starting position by extending the elbow and exhaling. Repeat.","['ez curl bar', 'bench']","Use a close grip with elbows tucked and upper arms stationary; control the descent and stop with the bar just above your forehead to avoid impact. Keep arms perpendicular to the floor and breathe properly (inhale down, exhale up)."
Decline EZ-bar skullcrusher,strength,triceps,intermediate,"Secure your legs at the end of the decline bench and slowly lay down on the bench. Using a close grip (a grip that is slightly less than shoulder width), lift the EZ bar from the rack and hold it straight over you with your arms locked and elbows in. The arms should be perpendicular to the floor. This will be your starting position. Tip: In order to protect your rotator cuff, it is best if you have a spotter help you lift the barbell off the rack. As you breathe in and you keep the upper arms stationary, bring the bar down slowly by moving your forearms in a semicircular motion towards you until you feel the bar slightly touch your forehead. Breathe in as you perform this portion of the movement. Lift the bar back to the starting position by contracting the triceps and exhaling. Repeat until the recommended amount of repetitions is performed.  Variations: You can use a straight bar or dumbbells to perform this movement. You can also perform it on a flat bench as well.","['ez curl bar', 'decline bench', 'barbell rack']","Secure your legs on the decline bench. Use a spotter to help lift the bar from the rack to protect your rotator cuff. Keep upper arms stationary and elbows in, and lower the bar slowly to lightly touch your forehead—control the movement to avoid striking your head."
Weighted bench dip,strength,triceps,intermediate,"For this exercise you will need to place a bench behind your back and another one in front of you. With the benches perpendicular to your body, hold on to one bench on its edge with the hands close to your body, separated at shoulder width. Your arms should be fully extended. The legs will be extended forward on top of the other bench. Your legs should be parallel to the floor while your torso is to be perpendicular to the floor. Have your partner place the dumbbell on your lap. Note: This exercise is best performed with a partner as placing the weight on your lap can be challenging and cause injury without assistance. This will be your starting position. Slowly lower your body as you inhale by bending at the elbows until you lower yourself far enough to where there is an angle slightly smaller than 90 degrees between the upper arm and the forearm. Tip: Keep the elbows as close as possible throughout the movement. Forearms should always be pointing down. Using your triceps to bring your torso up again, lift yourself back to the starting position while exhaling. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Caution: By placing your legs on top of another flat bench in front of you, the exercise becomes more challenging. It is best to attempt this exercise without any weights at first in order to get used to the movements required for good form. If that variation also becomes easy, then you can have a partner place plates on top of your lap. Make sure that in this case the partner ensures that the weights stay there throughout the movement.","['two flat benches', 'dumbbell', 'weight plates']",Use a partner to place and stabilize the weight on your lap. Start without added weight to learn the movement; adding weight and elevating legs on a second bench increases difficulty. Keep elbows close and forearms vertical; lower only to just under 90° at the elbows before pressing back up.
Reverse Grip Triceps Pushdown,strength,triceps,intermediate,"Start by setting a bar attachment (straight or e-z) on a high pulley machine. Facing the bar attachment, grab it with the palms facing up (supinated grip) at shoulder width. Lower the bar by using your lats until your arms are fully extended by your sides. Tip: Elbows should be in by your sides and your feet should be shoulder width apart from each other. This is the starting position. Slowly elevate the bar attachment up as you inhale so it is aligned with your chest. Only the forearms should move and the elbows/upper arms should be stationary by your side at all times. Then begin to lower the cable bar back down to the original staring position while exhaling and contracting the triceps hard. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variation: This exercise can also be performed with a single handle using one arm at a time. This will allow you to better isolate the triceps. With this version you can self spot yourself by placing your hand over your forearm and applying some pressure to help you perform more reps than before.","['cable machine', 'straight bar attachment', 'e-z bar attachment', 'single handle']","Secure the attachment to the high-pulley and use a manageable load. Keep elbows tucked and stationary with only the forearms moving; avoid using momentum or the shoulders/lats. Maintain neutral wrists with the underhand grip to reduce strain, control the descent and press, and avoid locking/hyperextending the elbows. Stop if you feel wrist or elbow pain."
Single-arm cable triceps extension,strength,triceps,intermediate,"With your right hand, grasp a single handle attached to the high-cable pulley using a supinated (underhand; palms facing up) grip. You should be standing directly in front of the weight stack. Now pull the handle down so that your upper arm and elbow are locked in to the side of your body. Your upper arm and forearm should form an acute angle (less than 90-degrees). You can keep the other arm by the waist and you can have one leg in front of you and the other one back for better balance. This will be your starting position. As you contract the triceps, move the single handle attachment down to your side until your arm is straight. Breathe out as you perform this movement. Tip: Only the forearms should move. Your upper arms should remain stationary at all times. Squeeze the triceps and hold for a second in this contracted position. Slowly return the handle to the starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions and then perform the same movement with the other arm.  Variations: You can use exercise bands to perform this exercise.","['cable machine', 'single handle attachment']","Keep your upper arm pinned to your side—only the forearm should move. Stand directly in front of the weight stack with a staggered stance for balance. Use a controllable weight, avoid jerking, and return the handle slowly. Do not hyperextend or lock the elbow forcefully; exhale on the downward phase."
Triceps Pushdown - Rope Attachment,strength,triceps,intermediate,"Attach a rope attachment to a high pulley and grab with a neutral grip (palms facing each other). Standing upright with the torso straight and a very small inclination forward, bring the upper arms close to your body and perpendicular to the floor. The forearms should be pointing up towards the pulley as they hold the rope with the palms facing each other. This is your starting position. Using the triceps, bring the rope down as you bring each side of the rope to the side of your thighs. At the end of the movement the arms are fully extended and perpendicular to the floor. The upper arms should always remain stationary next to your torso and only the forearms should move. Exhale as you perform this movement. After holding for a second, at the contracted position, bring the rope slowly up to the starting point. Breathe in as you perform this step. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations: There are many variations to this movement. For instance you can use an E-Z bar attachment as well as a V-angled bar or straight bar. Same as the Triceps Pushdown except with the rope attachment.","['cable machine with high pulley', 'rope attachment']","Use a manageable load, keep your torso upright with only a slight forward lean, pin your upper arms to your sides so only the forearms move, and control the motion without swinging; exhale on the pushdown and inhale on the return. Avoid locking out the elbows or letting the wrists bend excessively."
Seated triceps press,strength,triceps,intermediate,"Sit down on a bench with back support and grasp a dumbbell with both hands and hold it overhead at arm's length. Tip: a better way is to have somebody hand it to you especially if it is very heavy. The resistance should be resting in the palms of your hands with your thumbs around it. The palm of the hand should be facing inward. This will be your starting position. Keeping your upper arms close to your head (elbows in) and perpendicular to the floor, lower the resistance in a semi-circular motion behind your head until your forearms touch your biceps. Tip: The upper arms should remain stationary and only the forearms should move. Breathe in as you perform this step. Go back to the starting position by using the triceps to raise the dumbbell. Breathe out as you perform this step. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations:  You can perform this exercise standing as well but this puts strain on your back especially if you are using heavy dumbbells like 95 lbs or so. Another variation is to use an EZ or straight bar instead in which case you will be holding the bar from the inside (around 5 inches between both hands) with the palms facing forward (pronated grip). There is also a bar that has parallel bars inside (often referred to as a triceps blaster) and this can also be used for this exercise. Finally, a low pulley cable with a rope attachment or bar (straight or EZ) attachment at the end can be used for variety purposes as well.","['dumbbell', 'bench with back support']","Use a bench with back support and control the movement. If the dumbbell is heavy, have a spotter hand it to you. Keep elbows in and upper arms stationary to avoid shoulder/elbow strain. Avoid performing this standing with heavy weights due to back strain. Breathe in on the way down and out on the way up."
Dumbbell front raise to lateral raise,strength,shoulders,intermediate,"In a standing position, hold a pair of dumbbells at your side. This will be your starting position. Keeping your elbows slightly bent, raise the weights directly in front of you to shoulder height, avoiding any swinging or cheating.

Single-arm palm-in dumbbell shoulder press,strength,shoulders,intermediate,Start by having a dumbbell in one hand with your arm fully extended to the side using a neutral grip. Use your other arm to hold on to an incline bench to keep your balance. Your feet should be shoulder width apart from each other. Now slowly lift the dumbbell up until you create a 90 degree angle with your arm. Note: Your forearm should be perpendicular to the floor. Continue to maintain a neutral grip throughout the entire exercise. Slowly lift the dumbbell up until your arm is fully extended. This the starting position. While inhaling lower the weight down until your arm is at a 90 degree angle again. Feel the contraction for a second and then lift the weight back up towards the starting position while exhaling. Remember to hold on to the incline bench and keep your feet positioned to keep balance during the exercise. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. Switch arms and repeat the exercise.  Variation: This exercise can be performed with dumbbells in each arm as the dumbbells will help to keep you balanced. This is another great way to add variety to your routines and keep them interesting.,"['dumbbell', 'incline bench']",Use an incline bench for balance and keep feet shoulder-width. Maintain a neutral (palm-in) grip with the forearm perpendicular to the floor. Move slowly and under control—lower only to about a 90° elbow angle—exhale on the press and inhale while lowering.

Seated barbell shoulder press,strength,shoulders,intermediate,"Sit on a Military Press Bench with a bar behind your head and either have a spotter give you the bar (better on the rotator cuff this way) or pick it up yourself carefully with a pronated grip (palms facing forward). Tip: Your grip should be wider than shoulder width and it should create a 90-degree angle between the forearm and the upper arm as the barbell goes down. Once you pick up the barbell with the correct grip length, lift the bar up over your head by locking your arms. Hold at about shoulder level and slightly in front of your head. This is your starting position. Lower the bar down to the collarbone slowly as you inhale. Lift the bar back up to the starting position as you exhale. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations:  This exercise can also be performed standing but those with lower back problems are better off performing this seated variety. The behind the neck variation is not recommended for people with shoulder problems as it can be hard on the rotator cuff due to the hyperextension created by bringing the bar behind the neck.","['barbell', 'military press bench']","Lower the bar under control to the collarbone and keep it slightly in front of your head. Use the seated version if you have lower-back issues and consider a spotter for the handoff. Avoid the behind-the-neck variation, especially if you have shoulder problems, as it can stress the rotator cuff."
Seated Dumbbell Press,strength,shoulders,intermediate,"Grab a couple of dumbbells and sit on a military press bench or a utility bench that has a back support on it as you place the dumbbells upright on top of your thighs. Clean the dumbbells up one at a time by using your thighs to bring the dumbbells up to shoulder height at each side. Rotate the wrists so that the palms of your hands are facing forward. This is your starting position. As you exhale, push the dumbbells up until they touch at the top. After a second pause, slowly come down back to the starting position as you inhale. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.  Variations:  You can perform the exercise standing or sitting on a regular flat bench. For people with lower back problems, the version described is the recommended one. You can also perform the exercise as Arnold Schwarzenegger used to do it, which is to start holding the dumbbells with a supinated grip (palms facing you) in front of your shoulders and then, as you start pushing up, you align the dumbbells in the starting position described on step 3 by rotating your wrists and touch the dumbbells at the top. As you come down, then you would go back to the starting position by rotating the wrist throughout the lowering portion until the palms of your hands are facing you. This variation is called the Arnold Press. However, it is not recommended if you have rotator cuff problems.","['dumbbells', 'bench with back support']","Use the seated version with back support if you have lower back issues, and avoid the Arnold press variation if you have rotator cuff problems. Perform reps in control (exhale on the press, inhale on the lower)."
Standing dumbbell shoulder press,strength,shoulders,intermediate,"Standing with your feet shoulder width apart, take a dumbbell in each hand. Raise the dumbbells to head height, the elbows out and about 90 degrees. This will be your starting position.

Clean and press,strength,shoulders,intermediate,"Assume a shoulder-width stance, with knees inside the arms. Now while keeping the back flat, bend at the knees and hips so that you can grab the bar with the arms fully extended and a pronated grip that is slightly wider than shoulder width. Point the elbows out to sides. The bar should be close to the shins. Position the shoulders over or slightly ahead of the bar. Establish a flat back posture. This will be your starting position. Begin to pull the bar by extending the knees. Move your hips forward and raise the shoulders at the same rate while keeping the angle of the back constant; continue to lift the bar straight up while keeping it close to your body. As the bar passes the knee, extend at the ankles, knees, and hips forcefully, similar to a jumping motion. As you do so, continue to guide the bar with your hands, shrugging your shoulders and using the momentum from your movement to pull the bar as high as possible. The bar should travel close to your body, and you should keep your elbows out. At maximum elevation, your feet should clear the floor and you should start to pull yourself under the bar. The mechanics of this could change slightly, depending on the weight used. You should descend into a squatting position as you pull yourself under the bar. As the bar hits terminal height, rotate your elbows around and under the bar. Rack the bar across the front of the shoulders while keeping the torso erect and flexing the hips and knees to absorb the weight of the bar. Stand to full height, holding the bar in the clean position. Without moving your feet, press the bar overhead as you exhale.
